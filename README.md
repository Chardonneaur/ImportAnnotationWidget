# Matomo ImportAnnotationWidget Plugin

## Description

This plugin has been created in order to offer a User Interface within Matomo to import annotations.
By default, it is possible to import annotations within Matomo but only through the API. The issue is that end users don't know it.
So the idea was to create an easy viewable plugin that anyone can use to import annotations.
It has been created as a widget in order to quickly show that annotations have been imported within a graph.
In order to use this feature, Matomo end users will have to create a token, indicate the siteID they want to import the annotations for and then write the annotations in this format:
YYYY-MM-DD,my annotation to import
YYYY-MM-DD,my second annotation to import
YYYY-MM-DD,my third annotation to import
etc etc.
Possibilities offered by this plugin are endless, if you look at the source code, you can easily create your own version of this plugin for any other methods of the Matomo API to offer a User Interface.
Have fun,
