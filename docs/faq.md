## FAQ

__What is this plugin do?__

It provides you a user interface in order to import annotations.

__Why is it available on the dashboard panel and not in the admin?__

Good question. It is a choice we made. It would have been cleaner within the admin but on the other way around, it would have been difficult to view the result straight away on a graph.
